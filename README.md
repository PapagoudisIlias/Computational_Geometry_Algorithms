In this code I implement 3 algorithms from the field of Computational Geometry. The algorithms are, "ear clipping" for polygon triangulation,
"gift wrapping" for finding the convex hull from a set of points and "SAT" for collision detection between two convex polygons. 
The visualisation of the results is accomplished with the help of the CImg library. You can download the CImg lib at http://cimg.eu/download.html
